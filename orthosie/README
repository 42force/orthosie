Orthosie is licensed under the GPLv3. The details of this license can be viewed at http://gplv3.fsf.org/ until I get around to properly adding licensing information.

Orthosie is a point of sale system written in Python using the Django framework.
Currently Orthosie supports Python 2 & 3 and Django 1.5.

For the time being the default django settings file relies on being run from /home/bread/ To run it from another location update orthosie/settings.py to the location you are running it from.

Orthosie uses Django REST Framework. It can be grabbed from http://django-rest-framework.org/
